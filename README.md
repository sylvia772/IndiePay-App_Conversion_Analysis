\# IndiePay Conversion Analysis

\#\#  Project Overview

This project investigates why most users of IndiePay, a SaaS platform for freelancers, do not convert to paid after their 30-day free trial. The goal was to identify drop-off points and recommend strategies to improve conversion.

\#\#  Key Objectives

\- Understand where in the trial-to-paid journey users churn.

\- Segment users by behavior (feature use, support, engagement).

\- Recommend targeted interventions to recover potential conversions.

\#\#  Methodology

\- Funnel analysis of 260 trial users

\- Segmentation into Power Users, Light Users, etc.

\- Behavioral correlations: feature usage, support usage, bank connection

\#\#  Key Findings

\- 27% of users drop off after signup â€” weak onboarding

\- 40% of medium-engaged users still donâ€™t convert â€” unclear value

\- Nearly half of support seekers still churn â€” support quality needs review

\- Silent converters exist \-  some convert with low engagement, pointing to external motivations.

\- High usage strongly predicts conversion

\#\# Recommendations

\- Strengthen onboarding for light users

\- Improve in-app support quality

\- Target win-back campaigns for engaged non-converters

\- Learn from silent converters and power users
